# Donut project with c++

With this project i want to expand the knowledge about c++, debugging tools and nvim (because i find this excited), and make a donut, that will be work in the console and rotate.

## Future plans

Maybe i will expand this project, and make something more of it, but i dont know, what i should to do.

## Setup

In console on Linux:
- `git clone https://github.com/Happyigr`
- `g++ main.cpp misc.cpp terminal.cpp -o main`
- `./main`

Should be working :)
